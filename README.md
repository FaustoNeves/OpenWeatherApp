# WeatherNOW

One activity app that shows weather info. It consumes Weather API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
[Lottie's animations](https://lottiefiles.com/)
[Hilt dependency injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android?hl=en-us) (I used interface binding this time!)

The main aspects of this app is the usage of simple animations. Except for the splash screen (native animations), all animations were made with Lottie API
